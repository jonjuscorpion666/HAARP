`HAARP (High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program)` is a little-known, yet critically important U.S. military defense program .
The secret electromagnetic warfare capabilities of `HAARP` are designed to forward the US militaryâ€™s 
stated goal of achieving full-spectrum dominance by the year 2020. 

Here in HAARP repo , i am trying to introduce category theory and prove functional design pattern.

The exercises can be found in `src/main/scala/haarp/<tobefilled>.

You can test your answers with `./sbt test`

Make sure you run ./sbt test before the workshop -- the first time it runs, it will download the internet!

SyntaxHelp.scala explains some of the basic Scala concepts used or required by the examples, which may be of use.

Using the Scala REPL is highly recommended for working through the exercises, and exploring solutions.

`./sbt console`
